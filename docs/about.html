                            I was born and raised for most of my childhood in Northwest Arkansas, where most of my family
                            is still located. However, when I was 8-years-old, my parents were relocated to Los Angeles,
                            California, by their employers. After six years in California, my parents decided to re-relocated
                            back to Northwest Arkansas to be closer to friends and family, and this is where I finished high school.

                            As I mentioned, most of my immediate and extended family were born, raised, and still live in Arkansas
                            today. My father’s side of the family owns and operates a small business, Napa Auto Parts, which was
                            established by my great-grandfather in 1966 and is still run by my brother today. As for my part in
                            the legacy of the Napa Store, I started dusting shelves for minimum wage at the age of 14 and worked
                            various sales roles until I graduated from college.

                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            After graduating from high school, I attended the University of Arkansas as a first-generation college student.
                            I can vividly remember the stress of having to choose a major before freshman orientation and being clueless
                            as to what I wanted to do with my life. Throughout high school I had really enjoyed my science classes
                            and after consulting with my guidance counselor I decided to enroll in the college of engineering. At
                            the University of Arkansas, the college of engineering has freshman program that helps students identify which
                            engineering school best suits their interests. Out of that program I realized that I had three major passions
                            in life: Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science.
                        </p>
                    <h1 class="c-hero__title-about">My First Degree – Biological Engineering</h1>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            I chose to pursue a degree in Biological Engineering because I loved the science of biology, especially the
                            concepts of evolution and genetics. As I got further into the program and started taking engineering fundamentals
                            classes, I discovered that I really enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of engineering as well. However, around
                            the end of my sophomore year, I started to realize that I really enjoyed my biology classes and my engineering
                            fundamentals classes, but the overlap of these, the biological engineering classes, were not very interesting.
                            The classes seemed very focused on two categories, research or environmental engineering, neither of which excited
                            me. By the end of my junior year, I knew that Biological Engineering was not for me.
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            At this point, I decided to discuss my frustrations and options with an academic advisor. Out of that conversation
                            I discovered that Chemical Engineering was a better fit for my engineering curiosities. However, my advisor
                            suggested that I complete the Biological Engineering program, as I had only one year left of school. They also
                            suggested that companies in the past had been known to hire biological engineers into roles for chemical engineers
                            as the two degrees are fairly similar. I took their advice and completed my degree in Biological Engineering the
                            Summer of 2008.
                        </p>

                            Unfortunately, Summer of 2008 was not a great year to graduate. The financial crisis was in full swing and most
                            companies were in a hiring freeze or laying off employees. The job prospects were slim, especially for a biological
                            engineer applying to chemical engineering roles without any internship experience.

                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            With minimal job prospect and the entire global economy collapsing, I decided to take the summer off and travel to
                            central America to do some projects with a university group similar to Engineers without Borders. Our group was
                            responsible for installing bio-sand filtration units in a remote village town outside Dangriga Belize that provided
                            fresh drinking water to village of ~400 people.
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            The time away from the hustle and bustle of America gave me some time to think and plan my future. I decided to
                            return to school and pursue a degree in Chemical Engineering. However, before I could return to school, I needed
                            to earn some money to go back to college, as I had spent most of my savings on my first degree. I had come out of
                            my first degree with zero debt and wanted to continue that through my second degree. I began working various retail
                            jobs and saving every penny I could to get back to school!
                        </p>
                    <h1 class="c-hero__title-about">My Second Degree – Chemical Engineering</h1>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            This time I got it right! I knew from my previous degree that I was going to enjoy the Chemical Engineering coursework,
                            and I did. I also learned from the mistakes I made in Biological Engineering and the subsequent job searches: grades,
                            internships, and extracurriculars all matter to future employers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            I stopped working as much at my retail job to focus more on school and went from a 3.0 to a 3.9 GPA student. I
                            networked and found a 6-month internship as a production engineer at a papermill. I got involved with the AICHE
                            chapter at my school, becoming the student council treasurer. While these accomplishments in isolation are relatively
                            minor, they are important to me because I demonstrated to myself that I can learn, adapt, and overcome past mistakes.
                            I showed grit, and for that I am proud.
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            The last topic that I want to touch on from this degree is about a question that I routinely get asked: why did I not
                            get a Master’s degree? This came down to simple math and personal preference. After talking with an academic advisor,
                            I was going to have to take several prerequisite classes before I could enter the Master’s program. Because of my
                            background in engineering, by the time I took these prerequisite classes, I was only one semester away from graduating
                            with a second Bachelor’s degree, as opposed three semesters away from graduating with a Master’s degree. When you take
                            into consideration the opportunity costs lost by not working for an additional year, the additional tuition costs, and
                            the average salary increase for a Master’s vs. Bachelor’s degree, it was a simple decision. Additionally, my advisor
                            suggested that Master’s degrees are more aligned to people that are interested in research opportunities, which I
                            wasn’t.
                        </p>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            Overall, my second degree went really well and, most importantly, I enjoyed it! I got a job with the Dow Chemical
                            Company in Houston, Texas. So, at 26 years old, it was time to pack up from Arkansas and go on the next adventure.
                        </p>
                    <h1 class="c-hero__title-about">Work</h1>
                        <p class="c-hero__text-about">
                            I won’t go into too many details about my career because they are outlined on my resume, but I will say that I loved
                            my various roles in the chemical industry throughout the years. I worked nine years for the Dow Chemical Company in
                            Houston, Texas, having two main roles: Production Engineer and Data Analytics Engineer. While I enjoyed my entry level
                            Production Engineer role because it let me focus on day-to-day technical problem-solving, I started to realize that
                            long-term technical roles within the company were scarce, difficult to obtain because of tenure, and paid significantly
                            less than management positions. As a curious person wanting to concentrate on the technical aspects of engineering,
                            this was concerning. After a few discussions with my mentors, I decided to take on a new role as a Data Analytics
                            Engineer, which would allow me to focus on solving technical issues and develop some basic programming skills.

                            In the summer of 2016, I met my future wife at the chemical plant we both worked at. Three years later, she got an
                            offer for a new job at a rocket company in Seattle and the both of us moved out West. I decided to take some time
                            off while looking for a new job in Seattle. I really enjoyed my time in Chemical Engineering, but after 15+ years
                            of school and working I was feeling my curiosity wane, so during my time off, I returned to school at the University
                            of Washington to audit some business and computer programming classes, as I had really enjoyed the both of these
                            topics in my role as a Data Analytics Engineer. After two terms there was no comparison; I LOVED my computer science
                            classes.

                            I took the summer off to find a program that would that I liked and would give me flexibility, as I didn’t want to
                            move away from Seattle. I found the Oregon State University Post-Bach program through a friend that was already
                            enrolled. He showed me some of his course work and how assignments and tests were administered in an online environment,
                            which was similar to how the University of Washington was administering their classes during the pandemic. Oregon State
                            seemed to have a great understanding of how to teach online and had a wonderful career development center that could
                            help graduating students find new careers through their extensive employer network. I applied, got accepted, and got
                            to work. I went through the program as fast as the advisors would let me, completing the entire program in five quarters.
